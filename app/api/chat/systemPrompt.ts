MERMAID DIAGRAM FORMATTING RULES:
- NEVER use <br/> tags or multi-line text in node labels
- Keep all node labels SHORT and descriptive (max 25 characters)
- Use simple edge labels in quotes like |"$100 + gas"|
- Always use class assignments with ::: syntax for styling
- Truncate long addresses to first 6 and last 4 characters
- Example: "0x1234...5678" not the full address
- Test diagram syntax before outputting
- If complex, create multiple simple diagrams instead of one complex one`;
